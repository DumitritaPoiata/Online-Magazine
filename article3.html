            Studio Ghibli’s Impact On Animation
        </h1>
        <p>
            Studio Ghibli is no secret to any movie lover, since it  has successfully cast its spell over anime audiences worldwide for the past four decades. But what is 
            it that makes the Ghibli movies so magnetic, sensational and enjoyable for people across all ages and hemispheres?  Is it stage-presence, their value within a 
            story, or something else? When it comes to Studio Ghibli, there are dozens of characters who are beautifully defined and well-written. Strangely, those characters 
            aren't always the ones people best remember. For instance, Jiro Horikoshi of The Wind Rises is a fully-realized, historically-relevant protagonist reminiscent of 
            Miyazaki himself, but he's not the sort of character featured on t-shirts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The secret is the animator’s ability to create in-depth magical narratives that feel real because of their detail and fervour. As Miyazaki, co-founder and producer 
            of Studio Ghibli, has previously related, “animators are themselves actors”. That is to say, they must consider their character’s motivations, as well as who they 
            are with unspoken mannerisms and expressions. There’s also ridiculously minute detail that creates familiarity – this could be Chihiro, the main character of “Spirited Away”, 
            putting her shoes on, taking her time to tap them, make them comfortable, and scramble out like the movement of a real little girl.

        <h4>
            Food in Studio Ghibli Animations
        </h4>
        <p>
            Delicious food is a notorious hallmark of the company, but what makes that animated bento, onigiri or demon-cooked fried breakfast so special?
            Studio Ghibli films are comforting, and clearly a labour of love, which is exactly what you get from a good meal, cooked with care and attention in the 
            kitchen of someone who takes great pains to make things exactly right.
        </p>

        <p>
            Producer Toshio Suzuki recently said that the "secret" to why the food that is featured in practically every Ghibli movie ever made looks so delicious is that 
            the legendary Hayao Miyazaki has actually cooked most of the dishes himself. So what you are seeing on your screen isn't just an invention of an amazing-looking meal.
            You are seeing something that the director actually prepared and tasted himself.
