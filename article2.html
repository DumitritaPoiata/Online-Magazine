            How to become a Character Animator
        </h1>
        <p>
            Nowadays, the career spectrum has broadened a lot, with new degrees and specialties being consistently offered to us. Also, with the increased use of
            our smartphones, laptops, and TVs, the amount of digital content has sky-rocketed in the last 20 years. Video games, movies, TV-series, cartoons, smartphone
            apps… These are all here because of the hard work and talent of a special group, from which a big responsibility falls on the Character Animator.   
        </p>
        <p>
            The main duty of a character animator is to build and develop characters using different animation tools, 3D modeling, 2D animations, and others. Character 
            animators are always in touch with the sound engineering team to ensure gestures are in sync with the sound, and they work with consumers to help pitch ideas
            and create attractive designs. Character animators usually work in film and video production studios, advertisement agencies, and public relations firms. They 
            also work at colleges and universities and in other fields. It is truly an incredible career, where you can have the great opportunity to give life to images and
            ideas in different fields.

        <h3>
            If you are interested in becoming a character animator, here are some steps and tips you need to consider if you want to break into this action-packed, exciting field.
        </h3>
        <h4>
            1.	Start taking animation courses or apply for a degree
        </h4>
        <p>
            Did you know that 72.4% of character animators have a bachelor's degree? In terms of higher education levels, 8% of character animators have master's degrees. 
            Even though most character animators have a college degree, it's possible to become one with only a high school degree or after taking some courses, if you can
            prove you are a professional. Either way, be sure to pick a program that gives you hands-on practice with industry technology and that is taught by people with experience in the field. 

        </p>

        <h4>
            2.	Commit yourself and your time to developing your skills
        </h4>

        <p>
            It doesn’t matter how good your animation program is, your teachers/instructors can only teach you so much about how to become an animator. They can push you to achieve your
            best, but ultimately it is your hard work and dedication that will pay off. Besides building foundational art skills and learning animation and editing software, you’ll also
            want to develop skills that aren’t in the curriculum, such as acting and observation skills.
            By doing so, you can understand body language and movements on a deeper level, so that you can perfectly recreate specific emotions and qualities in your characters. Teamwork is another
            important one. You have to know how to be a team player, how to manage feedback and critiques, how to successfully collaborate with your peers.

        </p>

        <h4>
            3.	Have an exceptional portfolio and demo reel
        </h4>

        <p>
            If you ask any professional from a creative industry, they will tell you that the most important key is having a Stellar Portfolio. If you are thinking about applying to 
            this degree, look up its programs and see if they also help you build a good portfolio. For a character animator, it’s best to have your portfolio set online, where you 
            can create a section for a short demo reel and also an area for longer work samples. It is also important to only share your best work, and to include recaps of that work 
            you did and your overall project goals. Don’t forget, always keep creating, developing your work, and update your portfolio with new, better and stronger pieces. If you need 
            ideas, you can always take inspiration from other animators’ portfolios or, if you are at school, ask your career services team and instructors for advice and feedback. P.S: 
            include a contact section on your site as well as your resume and a brief overview of your background and interests.

        <h4>
            4. I know it’s cheesy, but Experience is Key
        </h4>

        <p>
            If you are still in school, look up internships or freelance jobs, go to UpWork or Fiverr and constantly gain valuable experience outside of classroom.
            Even after graduation, you are more likely to start with entry level positions, so don’t be afraid to start other freelance work, volunteering, etc. All of this experience 
            will give you the opportunity to network with other professionals, build and broaden your skills and help you expand your portfolio. The more on-the-job experience you get 
            under your belt, the more appealing you will be to your dream job’s company. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Animation is an extremely fun and challenging path to take. Now that you have an understanding of what it takes to become a successful Character Animator, it's up to you to take the next step.
